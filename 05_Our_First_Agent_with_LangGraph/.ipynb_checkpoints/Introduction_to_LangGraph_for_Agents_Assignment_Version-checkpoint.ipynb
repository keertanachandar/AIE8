        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",

        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

Through comprehensive examination, we\\npropose a novel hierarchical taxonomy that categorizes systems according to\\nfour fundamental technical dimensions: foundation models and reasoning engines,\\ntool utilization and environmental interaction, task planning and execution\\ncontrol, and knowledge synthesis and output generation. We explore the\\narchitectural patterns, implementation approaches, and domain-specific\\nadaptations that characterize these systems across academic, scientific,\\nbusiness, and educational applications. Our analysis reveals both the\\nsignificant capabilities of current implementations and the technical and\\nethical challenges they present regarding information accuracy, privacy,\\nintellectual property, and accessibility. The survey concludes by identifying\\npromising research directions in advanced reasoning architectures, multimodal\\nintegration, domain specialization, human-AI collaboration, and ecosystem\\nstandardization that will likely shape the future evolution of this\\ntransformative technology.

            "Fine-tuning is a machine learning technique used to adapt a pre-trained model to a specific task or dataset. Instead of training a model from scratch, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, fine-tuning involves taking an existing model that has already learned general features from a large dataset and then further training it on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This process helps the model specialize in the new task while leveraging the knowledge it has already acquired.\n",

            "Fine-tuning has become a popular approach in natural language processing, computer vision, and other fields because it allows for efficient use of computational resources and often results in better performance on specialized tasks.\n",

            "As for when it \"broke onto the scene,\" fine-tuning has been around for quite some time, but it gained widespread prominence with the advent of large pre-trained models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in 2018 and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models. These models demonstrated that pre-training on massive datasets followed by fine-tuning on specific tasks could achieve state-of-the-art results, revolutionizing the field of NLP and beyond.\n",
