    "Creating requests synchronously mean the work will be done one at a time. Only till the first request finishes can you move on to the second. An asychronous approach means that the requests are done parallelly. If the first request is taking too long, you can work on the second and third one at the same time. \n",
    "Some benefits of using an `async` approach include:\n",
    "1. If you have a large number of texts (in the hundreds or thousands), an `async` approach lets you make many requests concurrently. A `synchronous` approach means you have to wait for one request to finish before moving on to the next. This would take too long for a large data set. A synchronous approach might work if you have a very small data set - i.e. 5-10 queries total.\n",
    "2. Async scales better. Since you are not limited by the order in which things are done, you can work with other heavy operations like API calls. This also helps web servers scale because you need to serve many users at the same time.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",

    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "Prompt Engineering - writing effective instructions for the model so that the output has clear success criteria and meets your requirements more consistently.\n",
    "There are some techniques that work with any model, such as using message roles. However, the prompts may need to be adjusted based on the model. Even different snapshots of models within the same family can produce different results with the same prompts. For that reason, it is recommended to pin your applications to model snapshots for consistent behavior. And to build a way to evaluate the behavior and performance of the prompts so you update it as necessary.\n",
    "You can pass in different insructions which behave like certain roles (developer). You can also pass in prompts as certain roles. The `developer` role has the highest priority and are used as instructions for the model. The `user` role is prioritized after `developer`, and these are the instructions given by the user - the query asked. There is also the `assistant` role which are messages generated by the model.\n",
    "You can also pass in reusable prompts which can be updated without changing any of the code. This allows you to iterate until you consistently get successful responses.\n"

The context from Source 1 explicitly defines the \"Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem.\" It occurs when a CEO or startup founder, previously strong or personally involved in a specific function (e.g., product management, sales, marketing), intentionally hires a weak executive to run that same function after ascending to the CEO role. The reason for this is the CEO's reluctance to fully relinquish control or influence over the function that initially made them successful or got them \"to the party.\"  \n",
      "   \n",
      "2. The underlying pattern is that the founder or CEO struggles with letting go of their previous role or specialty, which leads to hiring a weaker executive in that area. This allows the CEO to remain the ultimate authority or key player in the function, even if it undermines the function's effectiveness.\n",

      "4. This problem ties into broader concepts in the context about executive hiring and management. Namely, executives have strengths and weaknesses; successful leadership involves recognizing and hiring strong executives rather than weak ones to cover a CEO's prior specialization. Moreover, hands-on involvement like micromanagement might sometimes be necessary to mentor and develop new executives, but intentionally hiring weak executives to maintain control is counterproductive.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:**  \n",
      "The \"Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem\" refers to the phenomenon where a CEO or founder, who previously excelled in a particular functional area (such as product management, sales, or marketing), deliberately hires a weak executive to run that area after taking on the CEO role. This happens because the CEO struggles to relinquish control over the function that brought them success and prefers to remain the dominant authority in that domain. The problem is named after Michael Eisner, who as CEO of Disney, was a brilliant TV executive but after acquiring ABC, allowed its performance to decline under weak leadership. Eisner believed he could fix ABC himself if only he had more time, showcasing how CEOs avoid hiring strong executives in their old specialties to maintain personal influence. This pattern leads to underperformance and organizational harm. It highlights the broader principle that companies should hire strong executives even in the CEO's former domain and support them appropriately, rather than hiring weak ones to preserve the CEO’s personal control.\n",

    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "The overall strategy to improve LLM responses is advanced or analytical prompt engineering techniques. All of these smaller strategies together will improve the responses and consistency of success.\n",
    "1. Chain of thought processing. Have the LLM think step by step and show it's reasoning before outputing the final response.\n",
    "2. Right now the LLM isn't allowed to use any external information. If we want a more accurate response, we should allow for different paths of reasoning which includes information that wasn't explicitly given to it by the user. We can also have the system think about the problem in different ways and then converge the ideas at the end for a more comprehensive response.\n",
    "3. We tell the LLM to `respond with \"I don't know\"` if it doesn't know the answer to a query. We can also have the system ask itself questions to create more in depth reasoning for each question.\n",
    "4. We can assign more well defined roles to the system so it understands what we expect from the responses better."

      "Answer: The main speaking tips mentioned in the video are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Build a Personal Repertoire of Techniques (09:23)**  \n",
      "   Observe effective speakers you admire and analyze why they are successful. Use this understanding to develop your own personal style by building up a repertoire (or \"armamentarium\") of speaking techniques and heuristics. The speaker emphasizes the importance of having a variety of ideas and methods that you can draw upon when presenting.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Have an Empowerment Promise to Start Your Talk (04:11, 05:13)**  \n",
      "   Instead of starting with a joke—which often falls flat because the audience is still settling in—you should begin your talk by making an empowerment promise. This means clearly telling the audience what new knowledge or benefits they will gain by the end of your presentation. For example, \"At the end of this 60 minutes, you will know things about speaking you don’t know now, and something among those things will make a difference in your life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cycle on the Subject (05:13)**  \n",
      "   Reiterate important points by going around your subject multiple times in different ways. The idea is to tell the audience what you want to tell them, tell them again, and then tell them a third time. This repetition helps reinforce key ideas without being condescending.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider Time and Place (09:23, 11:27)**  \n",
      "   Pay attention to where and when you are presenting. Visit the speaking location in advance to familiarize yourself with it, so there are no surprises on the day of the presentation. This helps you handle any unusual circumstances effectively. Also, keep environmental factors in mind, such as lighting—full lights rather than darkened rooms are better because it is hard for the audience to pay attention or see slides if they are drowsy or closing their eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Use the Right Techniques at the Right Time (02:03)**  \n",
      "   A diverse set of speaking techniques can improve your effectiveness even if you don't have inherent talent. Some heuristic or technique you learn may significantly impact your success, possibly even helping you secure a job or opportunity. The process of improving as a speaker is non-linear, and exposure to a variety of ideas can help you build your \"armamentarium\" to maximize the value and acceptance of your ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, effective speaking involves preparing specialized techniques, starting with a clear promise to engage the audience, using repetition strategically, understanding and controlling the speaking environment, and continuously building your personal repertoire of methods to suit different contexts.\n",

      "5. Asking: 'How do I get people to stay engaged throughout the entire speech? Give examples of differences I should incorprate depending on the time length, and the different mediums used while presenting.\n",
      "Answer: To keep people engaged throughout your entire speech, several strategies and considerations are advised based on the video content:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Start Strong with an Empowerment Promise (Source 5 - 04:11):**  \n",
      "   Instead of beginning with a joke, which often falls flat because the audience is still settling in, start by telling your audience what they will know or gain by the end of the talk. This \"empowerment promise\" sets expectations and motivates listeners to stay focused.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Balance Content Difficulty (Source 1 - 09:23):**  \n",
      "   Your content should neither be too obvious nor too hard. If the material is too obvious, people may be embarrassed to respond or engage; if it's too hard, they may have nothing to say or feel lost. Aim for that sweet spot to maintain engagement and encourage interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Build Personal Style by Observing Effective Speakers (Source 1 - 09:23):**  \n",
      "   Watch speakers you admire, analyze why they succeed, and develop your own repertoire of techniques and personal style. This helps in tailoring your presentation in a way that resonates best with your audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Slide Preparation and Simplification (Source 3 - 27:10):**  \n",
      "   Use slides effectively:\n",
      "   - Eliminate unnecessary titles to reduce distraction.\n",
      "   - Reduce the number of words on slides so the audience focuses more on you rather than reading.\n",
      "   - Since people have one language processor, avoid making them read and listen at the same time.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   This helps keep attention on your speech rather than divided between reading and listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Use Visual Aids Carefully (Source 2 - 31:17):**  \n",
      "   Avoid using a laser pointer because turning your head to point causes loss of eye contact with the audience, breaking engagement.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   Instead, put graphical elements like arrows on your slides to direct attention.  \n",
      "   \n",
      "   Also, ensure your slides are not \"too heavy\" — avoid too much text and include enough white space and imagery.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Contribute and Conclude Effectively (Source 4 - 56:02):**  \n",
      "   Toward the end of your presentation, clearly show your contributions and what the audience gets out of the talk. Use a contribution slide summarizing key points.  \n",
      "   \n",
      "   You can also signal you are finished by telling a related joke or using a clear concluding statement to help your audience mentally wrap up.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Adapting Based on Time Length and Medium:**  \n",
      "   Although the exact differences in time length and medium are not explicitly detailed, the context implies:\n",
      "   - For shorter talks, simplify content more rigorously to avoid cognitive overload.\n",
      "   - For longer talks, build a repertoire with varying engagement techniques (visuals, repetition, personal style) to maintain attention over a longer period.\n",
      "   - When presenting in-person (with laptops or visual aids), work on maintaining eye contact and use visuals that don't require you to turn away.\n",
      "   - For remote or web-based presentations, avoid overloading slides and compensate for lack of physical presence by clear verbal cues and compelling slide design (Source 3 and 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:** To keep your audience engaged throughout your speech, start with a promise of what they will learn, balance the difficulty of your content, simplify your slides to avoid divided attention, use visual aids without losing eye contact, and conclude with clear contributions and signals of closure. Tailor these methods depending on the talk length and medium by simplifying more for shorter talks and using a richer repertoire over longer ones, and always preserve engagement by minimizing distractions and maintaining audience focus.\n",

      "1. Importance of Communication Skills\n",
      "   - Success in life is largely determined by the ability to speak, write, and the quality of ideas (in that order).\n",
      "   - Students should be equipped with communication skills before entering life, similar to soldiers being armed before battle.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Formula for Quality Communication\n",
      "   - Quality communication depends on:\n",
      "     - Knowledge (K)\n",
      "     - Practice (P)\n",
      "     - Talent (T)\n",
      "   - Talent plays a small role; knowledge and practice are far more significant.\n",
      "   - Example: Patrick compares his skiing ability to Olympic gymnast Mary Lou Retton’s novice skiing to illustrate how knowledge and practice can outweigh inherent talent.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Objective and Promise of the Talk\n",
      "   - The talk aims to provide practical speaking techniques and heuristics.\n",
      "   - Attendees may find at least one technique that could help secure a job or opportunity.\n",
      "   - The learning process is non-linear, and success can come unexpectedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Rule of Engagement during the Talk\n",
      "   - No laptops or cell phones allowed.\n",
      "   - Reason: Humans have one language processor, and multitasking with digital devices distracts both the user and others.\n",
      "   - Presence of laptops negatively impacts speaker performance and audience focus.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. How to Start a Talk Effectively\n",
      "   - Avoid starting with a joke, as audiences may still be settling in and not mentally prepared for humor.\n",

      "### Introduction to Psychology and the Mind\n",
      "- The human mind is described as the most complicated known piece of the universe, governing consciousness and behavior.\n",
      "- Psychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental processes.\n",
      "- Despite the brain’s complexity, humans persistently attempt to understand it.\n",
      "- The term \"psychology\" originates from Latin meaning \"study of the soul,\" evolving considerably over centuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Historical Background\n",
      "- Early ideas about the mind date back to Aristotle, who mistakenly placed consciousness in the heart.\n",
      "- Around 2000 years ago, the Chinese implemented psychological exams for public officials.\n",
      "- In the 9th century, Persian doctor Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Rhazes described mental illness and established early psychiatric care.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Central Questions in Psychology\n",
      "- Psychology seeks to answer profound questions:\n",
      "  - Why do humans commit acts like genocide despite understanding their immorality?\n",
      "  - Do humans have free will, or are they guided by biology and environment?\n",
      "  - What is mental illness, and how can it be treated?\n",
      "  - What defines consciousness and the self?\n",
      "\n",
      "### Modern Psychology: Overview and Scope\n",
      "- Psychology covers how brains function, malfunction, heal, and influence behavior.\n",
      "- It explores consciousness, thoughts, feelings, and the essence of being alive.\n",
      "- It is a diverse and interdisciplinary science with varied schools of thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Notable Figures and Schools of Thought\n",
      "- **Sigmund Freud:** A pivotal and controversial figure who influenced ideas on personality, childhood, dreams, and sexuality. His work sparked both support and opposition.\n",
      "- Around Freud’s era, psychology had several competing schools:\n",
      "  - **Structuralism:** Initiated by Wilhelm Wundt and Edward Bradford Titchener in late 1800s Germany, focused on breaking down consciousness into basic elements via introspection.\n",
      "    - Criticism: Subjectivity and lack of scientific objectivity made it short-lived.\n",
      "  - **Functionalism:** Proposed by William James in the USA, emphasized the purpose and function of mental processes and behavior, inspired by Darwinian evolutionary ideas.\n",
      "- Freud began practicing in Vienna in 1886, specializing initially in nervous disorders.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Origins of Scientific Psychology\n",
      "- Scientific psychology began formally in 1879 with Wilhelm Wundt establishing the first psychology laboratory in Leipzig, Germany.\n",
      "- Wundt published *Principles of Physiological Psychology*, considered psychology’s first textbook.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Insights:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Psychology evolved from philosophical inquiries into a scientific discipline studying the mind and behavior.\n",
      "- Different psychological schools reflect distinct approaches: structuralism’s focus on elements of consciousness vs. functionalism’s focus on mental processes’ adaptive roles.\n",
      "- Freud’s psychoanalysis introduced groundbreaking but contentious ideas shaping modern psychology.\n",
      "- The field continues to address fundamental questions about human nature, consciousness, and mental health.\n",

      "Answer: Based on the video content, psychology differs from philosophy primarily in its approach and methods. While philosophy has long pondered questions about the mind, soul, and human nature (as mentioned with Aristotle and the early use of the term \"psychology\" around the sixteenth century [Source 2 - 00:00]), psychology emerged as a formal science in the mid-1800s that focuses on the scientific study of behavior and mental processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Psychology seeks to understand how the brain works, how it can break or be healed, and why we behave the way we do, employing empirical methods including observation and experimentation [Source 4 - 02:01]. For example, Wilhelm Wundt established the first psychology laboratory in 1879, aiming to study the structures of consciousness through introspection in a systematic way inspired by approaches in chemistry and physics [Source 1 - 03:02]. This scientific, experimental approach contrasts with philosophy's more speculative and conceptual methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, psychology integrates diverse schools of thought, including structuralism, functionalism, psychoanalysis, behaviorism, humanist psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience, which together form an empirical, multidisciplinary science of behavior and mental processes [Sources 1, 3].\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, unlike philosophy, which deals broadly with questions about the soul and mind mostly through reasoning and argument, psychology treats these subjects as scientific domains, employing experimentation and observation to systematically study behavior and mental processes.\n",
