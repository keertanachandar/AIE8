AI is used to perform workplace tasks by either augmenting or automating human labor. It helps with producing writing, software code, spreadsheets, and other digital products, distinguishing it from traditional web search engines. Users interact with AI with intents that include asking for information or advice, doing tasks (producing output), and expressing themselves. Generative AI is flexible and used across many different purposes, including professional work, self-expression, and creative uses such as games and role play. Additionally, AI serves as co-workers producing outputs or as co-pilots improving human problem-solving productivity.\\n\\nIn summary, people nowadays are using AI to:\\n\\n- Augment or automate workplace tasks  \\n- Produce written content, code, and digital products  \\n- Seek information and advice  \\n- Engage in self-expression and creative activities  \\n- Collaborate with AI as co-workers or co-pilots enhancing productivity\\n\\nThis captures the broad spectrum of how AI is being used according to the context.'"

Using AI to *augment* human intelligence—providing crisp decision support—makes the grind smoother and $$ greener.
