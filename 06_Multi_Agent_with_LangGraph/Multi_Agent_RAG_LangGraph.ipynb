Education is a major use case for ChatGPT. 10.2% of all user\\nmessages and 36% of Practical Guidance messages are requests for Tutoring or Teaching. Another\\nlarge share - 8.5% in total and 30% of Practical Guidance - is general how-to advice on a variety\\nof topics. Technical Help includes Computer Programming (4.2% of messages), Mathematical Calcu-\\nlations (3%), and Data Analysis (0.4%).

In contrast, Zao-Sanders (2025) estimates that Therapy/Companionship is\\nthe most prevalent use case for generative AI.9\\nWe also document several important facts about demographic variation in ChatGPT usage. First,\\nwe show evidence that the gender gap in ChatGPT usage has likely narrowed considerably over time,\\nand may have closed completely. In the few months after ChatGPT was released about 80% of active\\nusers had typically masculine first names.10 However, that number declined to 48% as of June 2025,\\nwith active users slightly more likely to have typically feminine first names. Second, we find that\\nnearly half of all messages sent by adults were sent by users under the age of 26, although age gaps\\nhave narrowed somewhat in recent months. Third, we find that ChatGPT usage has grown relatively\\nfaster in low- and middle-income countries over the last year. Fourth, we find that educated users and\\nusers in highly-paid professional occupations are substantially more likely to use ChatGPT for work.\\nWe introduce a new taxonomy to classify messages according to the kind of output the user is\\nseeking, using a simple rubric that we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing.11\\nAsking is when the\\nuser is seeking information or clarification to inform a decision, corresponding to problem-solving\\nmodels of knowledge work (e.g., Garicano (2000); Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006); Carnehl and\\nSchneider (2025); Ide and Talamas (2025)). Doing is when the user wants to produce some output\\nor perform a particular task, corresponding to classic task-based models of work (e.g., Autor et al.\\n(2003)). Expressing is when the user is expressing views or feelings but not seeking any information or\\naction. We estimate that about 49% of messages are Asking, 40% are Doing, and 11% are Expressing.\\nHowever, as of July 2025 about 56% of work-related messages are classified as Doing (e.g., performing\\njob tasks), and nearly three-quarters of those are Writing tasks. The relative frequency of writing-\\nrelated conversations is notable for two reasons. First, writing is a task that is common to nearly all\\nwhite-collar jobs, and good written communication skills are among the top “soft” skills demanded by\\nemployers (National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2024). Second, one distinctive feature of\\ngenerative AI, relative to other information technologies, is its ability to produce long-form outputs\\nsuch as writing and software code.\\nWe also map message content to work activities using the Occupational Information Network\\n(O*NET), a survey of job characteristics supported by the U.S. Department of Labor. We find that\\nabout 81% of work-related messages are associated with two broad work activities: 1) obtaining,\\ndocumenting, and interpreting information; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems,\\nand thinking creatively. Additionally, we find that the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage\\nare highly similar across very different kinds of occupations. For example, the work activities Getting\\nInformation and Making Decisions and Solving Problems are in the top five of message frequency in\\nnearly all occupations, ranging from management and business to STEM to administrative and sales\\noccupations.\\nOverall, we find that information-seeking and decision support are the most common ChatGPT\\nuse cases in most jobs. This is consistent with the fact that almost half of all ChatGPT usage is'),\n",

Education is a major use case, with many users seeking tutoring or teaching assistance (36% of Practical Guidance messages), as well as general how-to advice on various topics (30% of Practical Guidance). Users also utilize AI for technical help, including computer programming (4.2%), mathematical calculations (3%), and data analysis (0.4%). \\n\\nAdditionally, some users engage with AI for self-expression, such as relationships and personal reflection (1.9%) or games and role play (0.4%). The ability of generative AI to produce digital outputs like writing, software code, and spreadsheets makes it distinct from traditional web search, offering customized, often long-form responses tailored to individual needs.\\n\\nOverall, the typical usage involves information-seeking, decision support, and productivity tasks, especially related to writing, problem-solving, and learning.'}"

This report discusses the growth of context engineering, its role in enhancing LLM efficiency, and its broader effects on AI usage.\\n\\n## Understanding Context Engineering\\n\\nContext engineering involves the deliberate structuring and design of the environments, input data, and interactions that guide AI systems in processing information. Moving beyond mere prompt engineering, which focused on creating specific inputs, context engineering encompasses managing a comprehensive ecosystem of information. This includes the use of advanced memory systems, effective data retrieval strategies, and seamless tool integration, enabling LLMs to function within the most pertinent contexts.\\n\\n## Key Developments\\n\\n1. **Expansion of Context Windows**: Advanced LLMs like GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3 can now process context windows as large as 1 million tokens. This allows for comprehensive input handling that can include entire texts, significantly improving the depth and contextual understanding of AI responses.\\n\\n2. **Evolution of Dynamic Architectures**: The shift toward more sophisticated system designs enables LLMs to function as agents capable of reasoning based on accumulated contextual information, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of their outputs.\\n\\n3. **Efficiency in Business Applications**: Organizations employing context engineering techniques report substantial improvements, including tripled deployment speed and reduced operational costs by up to 40%. Accuracy rates of AI outputs have also significantly improved, reaching 90-95%, compared to the 65-75% typically seen in traditional systems.\\n\\n## Impact on AI Utilization\\n\\nThe rise of context engineering has altered how AI is used across various sectors:\\n\\n1. **Enhanced Human-AI Collaboration**: As LLMs utilize context engineering, they become more adept at enhancing human tasks—ranging from creative endeavors to complex data analysis—offering users responses that align closely with their intentions and context.\\n\\n2. **Broader Accessibility**: With advancements in on-device processing, AI applications can deliver instant responses while safeguarding user privacy. This makes AI tools more accessible within different sectors, thus improving overall productivity.\\n\\n3. **Evolving Skillsets for Developers**: Context engineering is now a key competency for AI developers. The ability to construct systems that curate relevant data and optimize information flow is crucial for ensuring the reliable performance of LLMs across various applications.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe rise of context engineering in 2025 marks a significant transformation in the development and application of AI technologies. By redefining how LLMs process and interpret vast amounts of information, context engineering enhances their functionality and reliability. This evolution paves the way for more interactive, intelligent, and user-centric AI systems, ultimately fulfilling the promise of augmenting human intelligence in a more profound and meaningful manner.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, name='HowPeopleUseAIRetriever')]}}\n",

    "### Report on the Rise of Context Engineering in the LLM Space in 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "As we move further into 2025, the landscape of artificial intelligence continues to evolve, particularly in the domain of large language models (LLMs). One significant trend emerging is \"context engineering,\" which has begun to outpace the earlier focus on prompt engineering. This report explores how context engineering is reshaping the dynamics of AI usage, enhancing the capabilities of LLMs to perform complex tasks, and ultimately influencing the way users interact with AI technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Emergence of Context Engineering\n",
    "In previous years, prompt engineering involved crafting inputs to guide LLMs to generate desired outputs. However, by 2025, the limitations of traditional prompt engineering have become evident, especially as applications require more dynamic interactions and multi-turn dialogues. Context engineering has emerged as a new paradigm, prioritizing the construction of strategies and systems that enable LLMs to access and utilize extensive contextual information effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern LLMs, such as GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3, now boast context windows that can handle up to 1 million tokens. This substantial increase allows these models to grasp more extensive content, such as books or lengthy documents, fundamentally changing what they can achieve in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Developments in Context Engineering\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Knowledge Management**: The shift towards context engineering facilitates more sophisticated knowledge management within AI systems. These systems now use persistent memory and adaptive reasoning, enabling them to maintain context across interactions. For example, agent-based LLMs can now engage in workflows requiring multiple exchanges, which is vital for complex applications requiring follow-ups and extended dialogues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Context Lengths**: Advances in transformer architectures have led to the possibility of extending native context lengths dramatically. As a result, LLMs can process larger datasets directly, enhancing their capacity to deliver accurate and relevant outputs without extensive re-prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context Compression and Retrieval**: Techniques such as context compression, where information is stored externally or synthesized to maximize relevance, are gaining traction. Methods identified in recent studies highlight the importance of integrating efficient retrieval systems and summarization techniques to make the most of the available context.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Rise of Multi-Agent Systems**: In 2025, LLM applications are increasingly shifting towards multi-agent architectures, where different AI agents work collaboratively, leveraging various tools and pieces of information to improve output accuracy and reduce operational inefficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Impact on AI Usage\n",
    "The implications of context engineering are far-reaching and transformative for users and organizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Enterprises adopting context engineering report accuracy rates of 90-95%, a significant improvement over the 65-75% typically associated with earlier methods. This rise in performance is generating more trust in AI systems across various sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster Deployment and Cost Efficiency**: Organizations employing structured context engineering have demonstrated a 3x increase in the speed of bringing AI solutions to production and a 40% reduction in operational costs compared to traditional prompt-based methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adaptability and Scalability**: Context-engineered systems are inherently more adaptable, allowing businesses to scale AI applications rapidly in response to evolving needs without overhauling the underlying architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Augmentation of Human Intelligence**: As context engineering allows AI systems to interact in more meaningful ways, they are increasingly positioned as partners in decision-making processes, rather than mere tools. This evolution enhances the collaborative potential between humans and AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "The rise of context engineering marks a critical turning point in the development and application of LLMs. As AI systems become increasingly capable of managing and utilizing complex contextual information, they are set to enhance user experiences, improve efficiency, and drive new innovations across industries. Organizations that embrace this trend will likely lead the charge into a future where AI is not just a tool for automation but a collaborative partner in problem-solving and creativity."
