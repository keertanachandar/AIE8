Education is a major use case for ChatGPT. 10.2% of all user\\nmessages and 36% of Practical Guidance messages are requests for Tutoring or Teaching. Another\\nlarge share - 8.5% in total and 30% of Practical Guidance - is general how-to advice on a variety\\nof topics. Technical Help includes Computer Programming (4.2% of messages), Mathematical Calcu-\\nlations (3%), and Data Analysis (0.4%).

In contrast, Zao-Sanders (2025) estimates that Therapy/Companionship is\\nthe most prevalent use case for generative AI.9\\nWe also document several important facts about demographic variation in ChatGPT usage. First,\\nwe show evidence that the gender gap in ChatGPT usage has likely narrowed considerably over time,\\nand may have closed completely. In the few months after ChatGPT was released about 80% of active\\nusers had typically masculine first names.10 However, that number declined to 48% as of June 2025,\\nwith active users slightly more likely to have typically feminine first names. Second, we find that\\nnearly half of all messages sent by adults were sent by users under the age of 26, although age gaps\\nhave narrowed somewhat in recent months. Third, we find that ChatGPT usage has grown relatively\\nfaster in low- and middle-income countries over the last year. Fourth, we find that educated users and\\nusers in highly-paid professional occupations are substantially more likely to use ChatGPT for work.\\nWe introduce a new taxonomy to classify messages according to the kind of output the user is\\nseeking, using a simple rubric that we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing.11\\nAsking is when the\\nuser is seeking information or clarification to inform a decision, corresponding to problem-solving\\nmodels of knowledge work (e.g., Garicano (2000); Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006); Carnehl and\\nSchneider (2025); Ide and Talamas (2025)). Doing is when the user wants to produce some output\\nor perform a particular task, corresponding to classic task-based models of work (e.g., Autor et al.\\n(2003)). Expressing is when the user is expressing views or feelings but not seeking any information or\\naction. We estimate that about 49% of messages are Asking, 40% are Doing, and 11% are Expressing.\\nHowever, as of July 2025 about 56% of work-related messages are classified as Doing (e.g., performing\\njob tasks), and nearly three-quarters of those are Writing tasks. The relative frequency of writing-\\nrelated conversations is notable for two reasons. First, writing is a task that is common to nearly all\\nwhite-collar jobs, and good written communication skills are among the top “soft” skills demanded by\\nemployers (National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2024). Second, one distinctive feature of\\ngenerative AI, relative to other information technologies, is its ability to produce long-form outputs\\nsuch as writing and software code.\\nWe also map message content to work activities using the Occupational Information Network\\n(O*NET), a survey of job characteristics supported by the U.S. Department of Labor. We find that\\nabout 81% of work-related messages are associated with two broad work activities: 1) obtaining,\\ndocumenting, and interpreting information; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems,\\nand thinking creatively. Additionally, we find that the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage\\nare highly similar across very different kinds of occupations. For example, the work activities Getting\\nInformation and Making Decisions and Solving Problems are in the top five of message frequency in\\nnearly all occupations, ranging from management and business to STEM to administrative and sales\\noccupations.\\nOverall, we find that information-seeking and decision support are the most common ChatGPT\\nuse cases in most jobs. This is consistent with the fact that almost half of all ChatGPT usage is'),\n",

Education is a significant use case, with many users seeking tutoring or teaching help (36% of Practical Guidance messages). Users also use AI for how-to advice on various topics (8.5%). Other common uses include technical help such as computer programming, mathematical calculations, and data analysis, though these are smaller portions of the overall usage. Additionally, ChatGPT is used for self-expression activities like relationships, personal reflection, games, and role play, but these constitute a smaller share. Overall, people use AI for information-seeking, decision support, producing written content, generating code, and practical problem-solving.'}"

    "2. We could also add more edges within the graph, instead of a freeflow graph where all agents flow through the supervisor. For example, there could also be an option where there is an edge from the search node to the retriever, and one from the retriever to the end.\n",

This report explores how context engineering has emerged as a crucial practice within the LLM space and examines its impact on AI utilization.\\n\\n#### Defining Context Engineering\\nContext engineering involves the strategic construction of data frameworks that empower LLMs to access and utilize contextually relevant information effectively. Unlike traditional prompt engineering, which typically revolves around crafting specific commands or queries, context engineering focuses on building a holistic environment that enables sustained interaction and adaptability within AI systems. This includes overseeing how LLMs retrieve, process, and incorporate contextual data to enhance response accuracy and coherence.\\n\\n#### Significance of Context Engineering\\nAs LLM applications become more sophisticated, businesses are discovering that the efficiency of these models often hinges on their ability to maintain and utilize context effectively. Failures in LLM performance frequently arise from inadequate contextual engagement, rather than limitations in the models themselves. This revelation has led to a growing emphasis on context engineering as a necessity for optimizing AI performance.\\n\\nKey elements of context engineering include:\\n- **Memory Systems**: Incorporating features that allow LLMs to retain and recall prior interactions within a conversation, enhancing continuity and relevance in responses.\\n- **Dynamic Data Utilization**: Enabling LLMs to access external databases and tools to retrieve real-time information, leading to more informed outputs.\\n- **Structured Interaction Protocols**: Designing communication patterns that streamline data presentation and improve the LLM's understanding and response quality.\\n\\n#### Emergence of Context Engineers\\nThe role of context engineers has gained recognition within organizations leveraging LLM technology. These professionals specialize in creating and fine-tuning the environments necessary for effective AI deployment, focusing on:\\n- **Optimized Interaction Design**: Streamlining processes that guide user interactions and ensure that models are fed with high-quality contextual data.\\n- **Enhanced Workflow Management**: Developing structured approaches to agent communication and escalation paths within AI systems to facilitate smoother operations.\\n\\n#### Impact on AI Utilization\\nThe rise of context engineering has transformed how businesses and individuals utilize AI:\\n1. **Operational Efficiency**: Companies report significant improvements in productivity and response quality when employing context engineering strategies, leading to higher levels of user satisfaction.\\n2. **Expanded Use Cases**: The ability of LLMs to manage complex contexts has broadened the scope of applications, including advanced customer service interactions and intricate problem-solving scenarios.\\n3. **Improved Customer Engagement**: Users benefit from AI systems that exhibit greater understanding and continuity in conversations, resulting in a more natural and fulfilling interaction.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nThe emergence of context engineering in 2025 signifies a critical evolution in the LLM landscape. By prioritizing effective contextual management, organizations are unlocking the potential of AI to deliver richer, more nuanced interactions. As the role of context engineers becomes more integral, the reliance on structured context frameworks will likely shape the future direction of AI development and application, ensuring that technological advancements continually translate into real-world benefits for users and businesses alike.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, name='HowPeopleUseAIRetriever')]}}\n",

    "### Report on the Rise of Context Engineering in the LLM Space in 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "As we move further into 2025, the landscape of artificial intelligence continues to evolve, particularly in the domain of large language models (LLMs). One significant trend emerging is \"context engineering,\" which has begun to outpace the earlier focus on prompt engineering. This report explores how context engineering is reshaping the dynamics of AI usage, enhancing the capabilities of LLMs to perform complex tasks, and ultimately influencing the way users interact with AI technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Emergence of Context Engineering\n",
    "In previous years, prompt engineering involved crafting inputs to guide LLMs to generate desired outputs. However, by 2025, the limitations of traditional prompt engineering have become evident, especially as applications require more dynamic interactions and multi-turn dialogues. Context engineering has emerged as a new paradigm, prioritizing the construction of strategies and systems that enable LLMs to access and utilize extensive contextual information effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern LLMs, such as GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3, now boast context windows that can handle up to 1 million tokens. This substantial increase allows these models to grasp more extensive content, such as books or lengthy documents, fundamentally changing what they can achieve in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Developments in Context Engineering\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Knowledge Management**: The shift towards context engineering facilitates more sophisticated knowledge management within AI systems. These systems now use persistent memory and adaptive reasoning, enabling them to maintain context across interactions. For example, agent-based LLMs can now engage in workflows requiring multiple exchanges, which is vital for complex applications requiring follow-ups and extended dialogues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improved Context Lengths**: Advances in transformer architectures have led to the possibility of extending native context lengths dramatically. As a result, LLMs can process larger datasets directly, enhancing their capacity to deliver accurate and relevant outputs without extensive re-prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context Compression and Retrieval**: Techniques such as context compression, where information is stored externally or synthesized to maximize relevance, are gaining traction. Methods identified in recent studies highlight the importance of integrating efficient retrieval systems and summarization techniques to make the most of the available context.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Rise of Multi-Agent Systems**: In 2025, LLM applications are increasingly shifting towards multi-agent architectures, where different AI agents work collaboratively, leveraging various tools and pieces of information to improve output accuracy and reduce operational inefficiencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Impact on AI Usage\n",
    "The implications of context engineering are far-reaching and transformative for users and organizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Enterprises adopting context engineering report accuracy rates of 90-95%, a significant improvement over the 65-75% typically associated with earlier methods. This rise in performance is generating more trust in AI systems across various sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster Deployment and Cost Efficiency**: Organizations employing structured context engineering have demonstrated a 3x increase in the speed of bringing AI solutions to production and a 40% reduction in operational costs compared to traditional prompt-based methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adaptability and Scalability**: Context-engineered systems are inherently more adaptable, allowing businesses to scale AI applications rapidly in response to evolving needs without overhauling the underlying architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Augmentation of Human Intelligence**: As context engineering allows AI systems to interact in more meaningful ways, they are increasingly positioned as partners in decision-making processes, rather than mere tools. This evolution enhances the collaborative potential between humans and AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "The rise of context engineering marks a critical turning point in the development and application of LLMs. As AI systems become increasingly capable of managing and utilizing complex contextual information, they are set to enhance user experiences, improve efficiency, and drive new innovations across industries. Organizations that embrace this trend will likely lead the charge into a future where AI is not just a tool for automation but a collaborative partner in problem-solving and creativity."
